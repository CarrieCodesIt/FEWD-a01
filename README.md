FEWD assignment 1

## Introduction
Hi, my name's Carrie and I'm a code girl! Or some might call us unicorns. We are girls that design and develop for the web! I used to code a few years ago but took a break and now I'm updating my skills to get back into the biz.

## What I Think About
One of my big concerns is trying to make sure my girls understand that they have options. Looking at the coding world today there's only a small percentage of women. The research shows that sometime around the early teens, girls stop being interested in science or stem. One thought is that they don't have strong female role models. My goal is to let my girls know that stem is always a possiblity.
